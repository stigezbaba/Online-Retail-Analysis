## Data Processing & Visualization Steps

The data was processed and visualized in Power BI to gain insights into sales trends and customer behavior. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1.  **Data Extraction & Transformation:**
    *   Loaded data from an Excel file into Power BI.
    *   Converted the first row into column headers.
    *   Split the combined date and time column into separate "Date" and "Time" columns.

2.  **Data Cleaning:**
    *   Removed rows with empty values in the "Description" column.
    *   Filtered out rows with negative or zero values in the "Quantity" column.
    *   Filtered out rows with zero values in the "Price" column.
    *   Cleaned text to remove any irregular alphabets.

3.  **Data Modeling:**
    *   Created a calculated column to determine revenue by multiplying the "Quantity" column by the "Price" column.

4.  **Data Visualization:**
    *   **Monthly Revenue Trend (2011):** Used a line chart to visualize revenue trends over the months of 2011.
    *   **Top 10 Customers:** Plotted revenue against Customer ID using a column chart, filtering to display the top 10 customers by revenue contribution.
    *   **Country Sales Analysis:** Created a column chart showing Quantity and Revenue by Country, excluding the United Kingdom (filtered out revenue > 4 million).
    *   **Geographic Revenue Distribution:** Used a World Map visual to display revenue generated by each country, excluding the United Kingdom.

5.  **Key Measures (Calculated in Power BI):**
    *   Total Count of Customers
    *   Total Quantity of Products Sold
    *   Revenue Per Customer
    *   Total Transactions Done
    *   Total Revenue Generated
